# CMPG 323 Project 4 - [36564567]

## Project Overview
Testing is a critical phase in software development, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a crucial step to ensure that the solution meets the desired requirements. In this project, we aim to automate the UAT process for a web application using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) through UiPath. The project involves reading input data, automating interactions with the web application, recording results, and deploying the solution.

## GitHub Administration
### Create and Configure GitHub Repository
- Create a repository named 'CMPG 323 Project 4 - [Your Student Number]'
- Create a ReadME.md file that describes the project and its usage.

## Project Progress
- Ensure that the solution is committed and pushed to source control regularly.
- Update the GitHub project iteratively to demonstrate progress.

## Project Setup
- Create the Project
- Clone your GitHub repository
- Install UiPath Studio
- Create a new UiPath process named 'Connected Office Web Application â€“ User Acceptance Testing'

## User Acceptance Testing
- Read the input data from Excel into a data table in UiPath.
- Ensure that the data is readable and iterated over in UiPath.

## UI Automation
- For each record in the data table, navigate to the URL in the browser that allows data entry to create a new record.
- Insert the fields from each record into the fields on the web application to create a new record.
- Click the 'submit' button on the web application to create a new record.
- Navigate to the URL where you can view the newly created record on the web application.

## Record Results
- If the item was created successfully, update the data table record to indicate a pass.
- If the item was not created, update the data table to indicate a failure.
- Update the Excel spreadsheet with the testing results in the 'Test Results' column.

## Project Close-out
- Deploy Solution
  - Publish the UiPath solution to the UiPath Orchestrator.

## Project Documentation
- Ensure that the ReadMe.md file in the GitHub repository explains how users can utilize the report.
- Create a reference list document that contains all sites visited and used to complete the project.

## How to Use This Report
Provide instructions here on how stakeholders and users can use the project's outputs and reports effectively.
